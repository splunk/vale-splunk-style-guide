[Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) is an open source prose linter that can check the content of documents in several formats against style guide rules. The goal of a prose linter is automating style guide checks in docs-as-code environments, so that style issues are detected before deploy or while editing documentation in a code editor. This repo contains a set of linting rules for Vale based on the [Splunk Style Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse).
